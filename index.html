    <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
    <p>
        Our visualization is designed to answer the question:
        <strong>"How does the estrus cycle influence female mice’s activity and body temperature, and how does that differ from male mice?"</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We chose a <span class="highlight">dual-line time series plot</span> to represent the two physiological variables—<strong>activity level</strong> and <strong>core body temperature</strong>—over time, with separate y-axes for clarity. Activity
        is represented by a <span class="highlight">solid steelblue line</span>, and temperature by a <span class="highlight">dashed tomato line</span>, helping users visually distinguish the two metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
        To support pattern recognition, I added <span class="highlight">shaded pink rectangles</span> to highlight estrus periods (every 4 days starting from day 2), guiding viewers to key windows of biological change. A <strong>dropdown menu</strong>        allows users to isolate individual mice and view patterns more clearly, avoiding overplotting. We included <strong>tooltip hovers</strong> to provide exact numerical values for each minute, and a <strong>brushing tool</strong> to enable zooming
        into specific time segments.
    </p>
    <p>
        I considered alternatives like area charts and stacked bar plots, but found that line charts offered better continuity and rhythm detection for time-series data. Additionally, we debated overlaying all mice at once but decided to start with one-at-a-time
        views to reduce visual clutter and support interpretability.

    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p>
        Our team, <strong>DataPhobia</strong>, consists of <strong>Jessica, Neil, Alex, and Seichii</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jessica led the development of the final interactive visualization, including data processing, D3.js implementation.</li>
        <li>Neil, Alex, and Seichii helped brainstorm the central question and visualization design direction during the early phases.</li>
        <li>Neil, Alex and Seichii also reviewed the implementation, provided feedback on usability, and contributed to exploratory data analysis (EDA) by generating static graphs to help shape the final approach.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We estimate that we spent roughly <strong>5 people-hours</strong> on this project. The most time-consuming parts were:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Implementing dual-axis interactivity</strong> and brushing in D3.js.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine-tuning the design and user experience</strong>, including axis labeling, hover tooltips, and estrus day overlays.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Through multiple iterations and peer testing, we refined our layout, interactions, and labeling to create an expressive and engaging visualization that clearly communicates our biological question.
